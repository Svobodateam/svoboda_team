# Svoboda Tracker

Svoboda Tracker is an application for employees, which allows them to request time-offs. There are four 
time-off categories: paid, unpaid, sickness with 75% of salary and sickness with 100% of salary.
Employee can retrieve information about how many day-offs left for him in current year and request for one at desired date.
